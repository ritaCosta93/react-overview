## üöÄ Components
- **NumbersList**: Goes through an array and **map the values to a list**.
- **UsersInfo**: Goes through an array of json objects and **renders the values to divs**.
- **UserProfile**: Receives **user details from props and renders them in a div**. The props come from a parent component.
- **PrivateContent**: Handles **conditional rendering**, depending on the value of a prop received from the parent component. Used the ternary operator instead of an if statement to render the content.
- **ClickMe**: **Handles an event** when clicking on a button.
- **UpdateUsername**: **Updates a state** with a **form input value**. Using **useState**.
- **TodoList**: **Updates a state**, a todo list, with items from a text input field. Also **removes items from the list**, updating the state when clicking on the item. Used the array method **array.filter()** to remove a specific item from the list.
- **Popup**: **Shows a popup that renders outside of the app root container.** It runs in a separate div and it's independent from the rest of the app. It was created using **createPortal**. There is button on the main app component that controls the visibility of this popup.
- **ThemeSwitcher**: This component uses the **useState** hook and a **switch structure to change the app main CSS classes**, changing the app color theme, choosing from 3 themes that are set clicking on a button.
- **Spaceships**: This component is using **axios** to fetch data from an API and using the hook **useEffect** to fetch the data as soon as the component loads. Adding an empty array after the useEffect callback makes it load once only.
- **Starwars**: This component fetches data from an API and uses the **Context API** hook **createContext** to share data to another component. This component is a **Data Provider**.
- **CorvettesList**: This component consumes data from the **Context API**, and filters it before rendering, using the ternary operator. This component is a **Data Consumer**.
- **Products**: This component uses the **useReducer** hook and implements a reducer to manage a list of products.
- **DoNotRerender**: This component uses the **useRef** hook on a text input to update a state without re-rendering the component.
- **CustomHook**: This component fetches data from an API using the call in a **custom hook** called useSpaceships. This hook lives in the hooks folder.
- **UseId**: This component uses the **useId** hook to give a text input a React generated id.
